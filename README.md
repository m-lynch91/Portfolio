# Portfolio
A public repository to demonstrate my code!

This is the place where I'll host any and all of the code that I think demonstrates where I am in my software development career. 

Humble beginnings: adding fun python scripts that I develop as I learn Python and read Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".
